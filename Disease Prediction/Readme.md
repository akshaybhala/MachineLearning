# Disease Prediction
### Learned about applying six different classification algorithms and how they are used to predict the unspecified disease. Learned how each parameter affects the performance of the model. How tuning hyperparameter tells us about underfitting and overfitting of data. Plotting Roc curve explains about the performance of the model. The finidings tells us that Random forest is the best model for this data set to predict whether the person has disease or not also learned about applying two different classification algorithms and to build ANN models and how they are used to predict the unspecified disease.
