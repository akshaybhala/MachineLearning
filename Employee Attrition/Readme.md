# Employee Attrition
## Goal is to determine association rules for Employee attrition and create an online responsive Shiny Application.

Perfomed Data Cleaning and improved data quality by removing NA's / Outliers and also checked for duplicate data / noise.
Anlalyzed clean data by creating various visualizations and using exploratory data analysing techniques.
Created Transactional matrix and applied Association Rule mining to get rules for both Attrition = Yes and Attrition = No
Built an online Application on Shiny Dashboard which allows User to change support/confidence/minimum length/maximum length and see how rules change accordingly and also displays plots for the same.
